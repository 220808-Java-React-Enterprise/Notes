### Pre-Req

#### War File
In software engineering, a WAR file (Web Application Resource or Web application ARchive) is a file used to 
distribute a collection of JAR-files, JavaServer Pages, Java Servlets, Java classes, XML files, tag libraries, 
static web pages (HTML and related files) and other resources that together constitute a web application.

#### Content and structure
A WAR file may be digitally signed in the same way as a JAR file.

The /WEB-INF directory in the WAR file contains a file named web.xml which defines the structure of the web application. 

If the web application uses servlets,then the servlet container uses web.xml to ascertain to which servlet a URL request will be routed. The web.xml file is also used to define 
context variables which can be referenced within the servlets and it is used to define environmental dependencies which the deployer 
is expected to set up. An example of this is a dependency on a mail session used to send email. The servlet container is responsible for providing this service.

##### Location

The War file is located in the target file in your project
directory
